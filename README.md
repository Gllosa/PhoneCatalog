# Phone Catalog

## `Description`
Phone Catalog is a web app that's displays a list of phones. When you click on any of them you can see extra information (apart from the image and the phone name) including a description, some specs and the price. All these information is taken from a local REST API. While the API request is ongoing the web shows a spinner letting, in this way, the user know that the web is actually working. Additionally, this app is responsive so that it can look good both in phones and computers.
