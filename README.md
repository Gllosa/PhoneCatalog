# Phone Catalog

## `Description`
Phone Catalog is a web app that displays a list of phones. When you click on any of them you can see extra information (apart from the image and the phone name) including a description, some specs and the price. All this information is taken from a local REST API. While the API request is ongoing the web shows a spinner letting the user know that the web is actually working. Additionally, this app is responsive so that it can look good both in phones and computers.

## `Run it`
In order to run the web app follow these steps:
1. Download the zip
2. Unzip the download directory
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project (make sure to get to the phoneCatalog-main folder wich contains all the code)
4. Execute `npm install`
5. Execute the api: `cd src` -->  `node api.js`
6. Execute the app: `npm start` (in another terminal, having navigated to the main app directory)

However, if you prefer it, you can directly access the non API version here: https://phonecatalog-react.netlify.app
