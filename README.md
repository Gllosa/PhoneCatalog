# Phone Catalog

## `Description`
Phone Catalog is a web app that's displays a list of phones. When you click on any of them you can see extra information (apart from the image and the phone name) including a description, some specs and the price. All these information is taken from a local REST API. While the API request is ongoing the web shows a spinner letting, in this way, the user know that the web is actually working. Additionally, this app is responsive so that it can look good both in phones and computers.

1. Clone the repository
